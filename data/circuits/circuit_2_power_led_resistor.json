  "name": "Basic LED Circuit With Power Supply and Resistor",
  "category": "Basic Electronics",
  "description": "A simple safe LED circuit powered by a 5V source using a 220Ω resistor to protect the LED from burning.",

  "componentsUsed": [
    "Power Supply (5V)",
    "LED (Red)",
    "220Ω Resistor",
    "Jumper Wires"
  ],

  "connections": [
    "Power Supply +5V → 220Ω Resistor",
    "220Ω Resistor → LED Anode (+)",
    "LED Cathode (-) → Power Supply GND",
    "LED glows safely because the resistor limits current"
  ],

  "howItWorks": "The resistor limits current flowing through the LED to prevent damage. When power is applied, current flows through the resistor and LED, causing it to glow steadily.",

  "powerNotes": "Use any 5V regulated power supply (Arduino 5V, bench supply, USB output).",

  "safetyNotes": [
    "Never connect LED directly to power without resistor.",
    "Ensure correct polarity: long leg is anode (+)."
