  "category": "Intermediate Sensor Circuits",
  "description": "Arduino Nano detects objects using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and lights a red LED through a 220Ω resistor when an object is close.",
  
  "componentsUsed": [
    "Arduino Nano",
    "HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor",
    "LED (Red)",
    "220Ω Resistor",
    "Jumper Wires"
  ],

  "connections": [
    "HC-SR04 VCC → Arduino 5V",
    "HC-SR04 GND → Arduino GND",
    "HC-SR04 TRIG → Arduino D9",
    "HC-SR04 ECHO → Arduino D10",
    "Arduino D13 → 220Ω Resistor → Red LED Anode (+)",
    "Red LED Cathode (-) → GND",
    "Arduino powered using USB or 5V regulated supply"
  ],

  "howItWorks": "Arduino measures distance using ultrasonic pulses. If the detected distance is below the threshold, Arduino turns ON the red LED via a safe current-limiting resistor.",

  "powerNotes": "Arduino powers both sensor and LED (low current).",

  "safetyNotes": [
    "Always use a resistor with LED.",
    "Avoid powering Arduino with more than 12V if using VIN."
