  "category": "Sensor Circuits",
  "description": "Arduino Nano connected with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a green LED indicator. LED turns on based on simple detection logic.",
  
  "componentsUsed": [
    "Arduino Nano",
    "HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor",
    "LED (Green)",
    "Jumper Wires"
  ],

  "connections": [
    "HC-SR04 VCC → Arduino 5V",
    "HC-SR04 GND → Arduino GND",
    "HC-SR04 TRIG → Arduino D9",
    "HC-SR04 ECHO → Arduino D10",
    "Green LED Anode (+) → Arduino D13",
    "Green LED Cathode (-) → GND",
    "Arduino Nano powered via USB or regulated 5V"
  ],

  "howItWorks": "Arduino triggers the ultrasonic sensor and reads the echo time to calculate distance. If the distance meets predefined condition, the green LED lights up.",

  "powerNotes": "Arduino supplies 5V to HC-SR04 and LED.",

  "safetyNotes": [
    "HC-SR04 must be powered only at 5V.",
    "Avoid pointing sensor at soft materials; they absorb sound."
