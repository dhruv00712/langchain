  "name": "Arduino Nano LED Blink (No Resistor)",
  "category": "Beginner Arduino Circuits",
  "description": "Basic LED blink using Arduino Nano without any resistor. LED is connected directly to a digital pin to demonstrate the simplest blinking example.",
  
  "componentsUsed": [
    "Arduino Nano",
    "LED (Red)",
    "Jumper Wires",
    "9V Battery"
  ],

  "connections": [
    "Battery + (positive) → Arduino Nano VIN",
    "Battery - (negative) → Arduino Nano GND",
    "Arduino Nano D13 → LED Anode (+)",
    "LED Cathode (-) → Arduino GND"
  ],

  "howItWorks": "Arduino toggles the D13 pin HIGH and LOW with a delay, causing the LED to blink. The LED is connected directly without resistor, which works for demonstration but is not safe for long-term use.",

  "powerNotes": "Circuit is powered using a 9V battery connected to VIN and GND.",
  
  "safetyNotes": [
    "Not recommended for continuous use because LED can draw excess current.",
    "Ensure correct battery polarity to avoid damage.",
    "Running without resistor is only safe for quick testing."
